Mod2Dlc Patches
===============

This directory contains the various binary patches that Mod2Dlc makes. Though
only one version of CvGameDatabase is patched for now, there's mechanisms in
place already for patching different versions/etc.

There's a directory here, "binaries/" which is excluded-- I don't want to
redistribute that, or put too many binaries in my git repo. If you want a copy
of it, email <lymia@lymiahugs.com>.

If you have a cygwin environment, you can try getting make.sh to work, but,
like the main program, there's currently no simple build system.
